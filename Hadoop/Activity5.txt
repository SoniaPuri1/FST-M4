sing vim, create a file named EmpData.csv and add the data from the previous slide in it.

$ vim EmpData.csv
Once the data is added and saved, run the hive command to start the Hive CLI:

$ hive

hive> SELECT * FROM employee;

hive> SELECT COUNT(*) FROM employee;

# A simple GET request from HDFS
hive> SELECT * FROM employee;


# Column operations
hive> SELECT  id, name FROM employee;
# Row operation
hive> SELECT * FROM employee WHERE salary > 30000;
# Column operation that need aggregation
hive> SELECT count(*) FROM employee; 

To export results to local filesystem, run the following query:
#Exports to LOCAL directory
hive> INSERT OVERWRITE LOCAL DIRECTORY '/export' 
    > ROW FORMAT DELIMITED FIELDS TERMINATED BY ','
    > SELECT * FROM emp.employee;


To view the result, you can use the cat command in regular Linux shell:
$ cat /path/to/result/* > output.csv
